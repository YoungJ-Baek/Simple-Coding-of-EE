Gradient descent
=============

There are two functions given by.
First one used in local minima and maxima is multiplication of two different sine functions.
Second one used in two peaks is sum of two gaussian functions.

You can simulate gradient descent by changing psi, eta, dx, dy, and starting point.
You can compare accuracy and complexity by different settings.
Also, you can find correlation between each parameters and find best values.
